The Post-PhD Manifesto: Shredding the old system for open, signal-based science

**THE POST-PhD MANIFESTO**  
*“Knowledge is not inherited. It is built, broken, and rebuilt—openly, endlessly, without robes.”*

---

### **PREAMBLE**  
We reject the cathedral.  
We dismantle the guild.  
We declare **learning a public act**, not a private coronation.

The PhD is dead.  
Long live **discovery**.

### **THE 7 ARTICLES OF OPEN SCIENCE**

#### **ARTICLE I – PREPRINTS OVER PERMISSION**  
All ideas are born in public.  
No embargo. No “under review.”  
**arXiv, bioRxiv, GitHub, or bust.**  
If it’s not online in 24 hours, it’s already obsolete.

#### **ARTICLE II – CODE IS THE NEW PEER REVIEW**  
Words lie.  
**Code runs.**  
No paper is valid without executable proof.  
Fork it. Break it. Improve it.  
**Reproducibility is not optional—it is the entry fee.**

#### **ARTICLE III – PREDICTION TRUMPS P-VALUE**  
Statistical ritual is dead.  
**Make a falsifiable bet.**  
Track it on Manifold, Kalshi, or your own ledger.  
The scientist with the best batting average wins.  
**Accuracy > Authority.**

#### **ARTICLE IV – REPLICATION IS CURRENCY**  
Every failed replication pays **$100 bounty**.  
Every successful one earns **reputation points**.  
**The Replication Leaderboard replaces the h-index.**

#### **ARTICLE V – PEER REVIEW IS PUBLIC COMBAT**  
No anonymous referees.  
**Named. Real-time. On-chain.**  
Reviewer score = % of their critiques that age well.  
**Bad reviewers get downvoted into oblivion.**

#### **ARTICLE VI – IMPACT = FORKS + BUILDS**  
Citations are vanity.  
**Did someone build on your work?**  
Did a startup ship it? Did a kid in Kenya run your model?  
**That’s impact.**  
Track it with **GitHub stars, Docker pulls, and real-world deployments.**

#### **ARTICLE VII – NO TITLES. ONLY TRACK RECORDS**  
“Dr.” is noise.  
**Your Signal Score is your identity:**  

Signal = (Prediction Accuracy × Replication Rate × Build Impact) / Ego

Update weekly. Public. Unforgeable.
